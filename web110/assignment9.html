    <h2>Assignment 9 Summary</h2>

    <p>This week I created an index page containing a list of all my previous assignments.
        I was pretty familiar with making an unordered list, since I am in the Web 150 class as well,
        so it was not too hard, but the thing I took away from this assignment was how important it is
        to keep your code and files set up and orgainized nicely.
        <br><br>
        With good formatting and orgainization, it was easier to create an index page copying and pasting the
        basic html structure from one of the previous assignments, and easier to create the list as I was able to
        write the one line of code for the anchor link to the first assignment, and copy and paste the rest, only changing the assignment number.
        <br><br>
        Keeping good orgainization and coding for the future will be very important in actually getting a job in web development, not just knowing
        how to code.
    </p>
