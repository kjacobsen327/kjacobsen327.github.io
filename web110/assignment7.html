        <h3>Activity 1:</h3>
        <p>
            For the first activity I chose to do activity 3: Verify internet connectivity.
            <br><br>
            I went through each step, using ipconfig to see my ip address, using ping to verify connectivity outside of my network,
            using tracert to trace the path to Googles server 8.8.8.8. I also used the traceroute-online.com site to visually see how it hopped from point to point.
            I then used the nslookup command to view all the different ip addresses for Googles servers.
            <br><br>
            I can see how learning these things will be possibly useful in the future, both in a career and even in my own home.
            I understand that in web development I will need to host a site on a web server, and there may be issues with people not
            being able to view the site. Some of these tools could be helpful to troubleshoot the problem of if the server is not working
            or if it is just the local computer that cannot access the site because their network is not working.

        <h3>Activity 2:</h3>
        <p>
            For the second activity, I chose to do the 7th activity, which was to research, identify and describe the necessary components required to set-up a home network for yourself.
            <br><br>
            The first thing and (probably most important) you need to set up a home network is a subscription with your internet service provider to provide a connection to your house. Around
            here, the options are only DSL, satellite, or cable, hopefully one day fiber will be an option. Then you need a modem, which turns the analog signal from the cable to a digital one.
            You can then connect a router to the modem, although sometimes they are built into the modem as well. The router will allow your devices to connect to each other on your home network,
            and also connect to the internet outside of your network. You can either plug in the devices to the router, but having a wifi router and wireless devices are the easier way to do it now.
            After getting the devices connected, you can make a workgroup through Windows, which makes it easier to share files and printers or other devices on your local network.
            <br><br>
            I will eventually plan on setting up a home network, I feel like it will be useful with a web development job which might have you work from home some days. Also my fiance is getting into
            graphic arts, so it would be nice to set up an easier way to share things over our home network.
