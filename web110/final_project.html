        <h2>What I've learned...</h2>
        <p>Over the course of this semester, I have learned a great deal, starting with some internet fundamentals like
            different web browsers, email, and search engines, and working towards learning more about web design and
            development.</p>
        <p>The web design and development portion is what really interested me though this semester, and it it what
            I would like to be switching to now, I had done some basic IT courses last semester but wasn't sure which
            path I would like to take until this semester.</p>
        <p>In addition to learning some of the basics in this course about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have been
            taking Web150 where we have also learned a lot about these topics, as well as spending time to try to learn
            more online.</p>
        <p>I'm happy to have found a school path that I want to keep persuing, I will be excited to take the
            JavaScript class in the fall, as I have found that to be the hardest thing for me to understand so far. In
            the meantime I will keep practicing on learning as much as I can this summer!</p>
        <p>Thank you for teaching this class!</p>
