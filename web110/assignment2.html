                <h3>Activity 1:</h3>
                <h4>I went to the site <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/internet-tips/">GCFLearnFree: Internet Tips</a>.
                    <p>I learned  about how URLS work and the different components that make up a Url. I  learned about how a URL is made up
                    of a domain name and the parts written after that are called the file path, the parameters, and the anchor at the end. I 
                    also researched how to add links and images to a web page.</p>

                <h4>I also chose to do the activity: Configure browser extensions. I checked for the most popular add-ons to chrome. 
                    I found and installed a new theme for chrome that is darker. I thought this might help my eyes since I will be looking
                     at the screen a lot in school. And because it looked cooler. :)
