                <h3>Activity 1:</h3>
                    <p>For the first activity, I chose to do the first activity: read the tutorials from the site <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/internet_technologies/web_browsers.htm">TutorialsPoint: Web Browser</a> 
                        and the site <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/internet-tips/">GCFLearnFree: Internet Tips</a>.
                        <br><br>From the GCFLearnFree site I was interested in learning about how URLS work and the different components that make up a URL. I  learned about how a URL is made up
                        of a domain name and the parts written after that are called the file path, the parameters, and the anchor at the end. So for example, for this assignment 
                        <b>http://github.io</b> is the domain name and <b>/web110/assignment2.html</b> is called the file path.

                    </p>
                    <p>I felt like this would be useful to know for a future in web development and for my upcoming week in my web150 class where we will learn about web hosting.</p>

                <h3>Activity 2:</h3>
                    <p>I also chose to do the activity: Configure browser extensions.
                        <br><br>I checked for the most popular add-ons to chrome. I already have installed a password manager called Bitwarden, and an ad blocker called uBlock Origin.
                        I have been using them for a while and will stick with them. I did find an extension called CrxMouse Gestures and installed that into chrome. It lets you hold down
                        the right click button and drag your mouse in a certain way to make a gesture that tells your browser to do something certain. For instance, now I can hold down the right click
                        button and swipe left, it tells the browser to go back a page, and in reverse, if I hold down the button and swipe right, it tells the browser to go forward.
                        <br><br>The password manager has been very useful and I'm sure will help in the future, as it has extensions for both chrome and firefox browsers and probably more, as well as my phone. It
                        will be easy to keep track of passwords between multiple browsers or if I am working somewhere like the school's computer lab that does not have my passwords saved.
                        <br><br>I also found and installed a new theme for chrome that is darker. I thought this might help my eyes since I will be looking
                        at the screen a lot in school. And because it looked cooler. :)
