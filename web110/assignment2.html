                <h4>I went to the site <a href="https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/internet-tips/"></a>.<p>I learned  about how URLS work and the different components that make up a Url. I  learned about how a URL is made up
                    of a domain name and the parts written after that are called the file path, the parameters, and the anchor at the end.</p>

                <h4>I also chose to do the activity: Configure browser extensions. I checked for the most popular add-ons to chrome. 
                    I found and installed a new theme for chrome that is darker. I thought this might help my eyes since I will be looking
                     at the screen a lot in school. And because it looked cooler. :)
