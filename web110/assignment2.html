                <h4>I did activity 5: Configure browser extensions. I checked for the most popular add-ons to chrome. I found and installed a new
                    theme for chrome that is darker. I thought this might help my eyes since I will be looking at the screen a lot in school. And
                    because it looked cooler. :)
