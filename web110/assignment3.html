                <h3>Activity 1:</h3>
                    <p>For the first activity, I chose to do third activity of using search engines.
                         <br><br>
                         I was interested in learning more about the advanced search techniques like the
                          <a href="https://www.google.com/advanced_image_search">advanced image search</a>
                          and using <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en">search operators</a>. I actually used it to
                          help figure out a problem I was having in learning CSS today!
                          <br><br>
                          I know this will be a very useful skill to know for both web design and web development. The advanced
                          search will help find specific images when designing the look of a website when you need something like a square picture
                          or something with transparency. Using googles search engine operators will also be very helpful in the future
                          when I will need help with coding, I can specifically find results from a site like w3schools or stackexchange.

                <h3>Activity 2:</h3>
                    <p>I also chose to do the fourth activity to learn about search engine optimization (SEO).
                        <br><br>I was reading about SEO from the site <a href="https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo">moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo</a>
                        and learned how a search engine crawls the web to find sites and indexes into a database, and ranks the site based on what a 
                        person has searched for.
                        <br><br>This will be very helpful to know for the future, as I have been interested in working with smaller businesses to design
                        websites. It is not very useful to design a nice website for a business but have it so far down in search results that nobody will see it.
                        It is very important to desin the site so that the spider can easily navigate the site, and find relevant content. It is also important to
                        use Google's My Business Listing especially for a small business that might deal with more local customers. It is also important to do
                        research on keywords: specifically what people are searching for and how to get an edge up in search results. The main thing that I will
                        take away from this is just to build a good website with good content, and not to try to rely on tricks in order to get ranked higher in a
                        search, because Google's search engine is very smart and can see through those tricks!
