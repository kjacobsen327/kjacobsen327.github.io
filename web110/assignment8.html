                <h3>Activity 1:</h3>
                    <p>
                        I chose the activity on the list to research and set up a password managers and multi factor authentication. 
                        <br><br>
                        I have my passwords saved to my google account but looked up other password managers as well. I got the Bitwarden password manager extension for Chrome on my desktop,
                        and downloaded the app on my phone. I also set up MFA for my Paypal account, so now it requires a code from a text sent to my phone.
                        <br><br>
                        The password manager was easy to use, I added some passwords from sites I use a lot and I also used the option to randomly generate a 20 character more secure password for
                        some of the accounts that I wanted to be more secure, like my banking accounts.
                     <br><br>
                        This will increase my online security for the future as it will be impossible to guess a 20 character long string of random digits and characters,
                        as well as also guess the code sent to my phone. For a little bit of work it is well worth doing from now on.
                    </p>

                <h3>Activity 2:</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the 2nd activity, I chose to test my firewall using the testing service <a href="https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2">Gibson Research: ShieldsUP</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        I did the tests to check the FTP and other ports on my network to see if they were open to attack, and also did the UPnP test. Luckily there were no security issues,
                        but it was good to make sure. Before this activity, I had no idea that this could be an issue, but now I see how it could be a big risk in that someone could use an open
                        port to find their way in to a network for bad reasons. This could be very bad for either an individual, or a company, where sensitive information is at risk.
                        <br><br>
                        I liked that this site was easy to use and provided a quick way to check security of your network. I could be using this again in the future for web devopment job, if say
                        I have a work computer at a company, or even if I am using a laptop at a public wifi hotspot. I might have access to the companies information or databases that I wouldn't want to expose.
