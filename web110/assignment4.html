                <h3>Activity 1:</h3>
                    <p>For the first activity, I chose to do the first activity which was to complete the tutorials from the GCF Global and TutorialsPoint websites.
                         <br><br>
                         Even though I went in to this week thinking I knew enough about email already, I did learn a few things I
                         didn't know previously. Anyone who has an email account will probably end up recieving spam at some point, and even though I knew already
                         to usually just delete the obvious spam emails, once in a while there is one that you might open up not realizing it is spam. I learned that 
                         spam emails can contain images that the sender can track, and when you open up the email, the image will load and will tell the spammer that
                         the email works, which they can use to send more spam or add your email to other spammers.
                         <br><br>
                         I found out that you can turn off email images to load automatically, so I followed the guide on how to do that. Not only will I hopefully
                         receive less spam in the future now, but now I will be able to possibly help someone else who is receiving an increased amount of spam, or 
                         who might be more at risk of falling for an email phising scam like my mother in law who didn't grow up using emails and as much knowledge about them.

                <h3>Activity 2:</h3>
                    <p>I also chose to do the third activity which was to use an email client program.
                        <br><br>I followed the directions and downloaded and installed Mozilla: Thunderbird on my desktop at home. I then configured Thunderbird to connect to
                        my main Gmail account as well as my Harper email account.
                        <br><br>I like the Thunderbird client a lot, and will continue to use it now. I like that it is easier to read emails from both
                        accounts now, as before I was logging in to the student portal and clicking the link there to check my school email.
                        For the future not only will this save time, but it will be most helpful if you had more emails to check like a business email account.
                        This would help make sure that you don't miss reading an important email. It is also nice that it works well with a Linux operating system, as I may have
                        to use a work computer that uses it. I see that there is a version for android devices that has come out pretty recently, I hope that they will end up making
                        it work on IOS devices as well one day.
