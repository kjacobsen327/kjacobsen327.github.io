                <h3>Activity 1:</h3>
                    <p>For the first activity, I chose to create a LinkedIn account.  I set up my profile and added a little bit about me and my strengths.
                         <br><br>
                         I was glad I took the time to do this activity, I knew that it was a popular social media website before this week but didn't feel like
                         it was worth making a LinkedIn. Now that I am focusing on a career in tech, specifically Web Development, I realize that this platform is
                         a great way to both search for future jobs, as well as those jobs searching for employees. This will be great to keep updating in the future
                         as I learn new skills and gain work experience.

                <h3>Activity 2:</h3>
                    <p>I also chose to do the third activity which was to review the honeycomb model and evaluate some of the most popular social media websites.
                        <br><br>
                        After reading up on the honeycomb model, I realized that the most popular social media websites have became the most popular, probably because they follow this model.
                        Some of the social media websites either do a good job of combining all aspects of the honeycomb model, while other ones are more focused on a few of the parts specifically, and the parts they
                        are focused on are done really well.
                        <br><br>
                        For instance, I think that one of the biggest social media website that people use - Facebook - has done a great job at using most of the parts of the honeycomb model. The biggest thing it promotes
                        is probably identity, sharing, and relationships. It is easy to let other people know more about you in your bio section, and makes it very easy to add friends and family and share or tag photos with them. 
                        It is also great for creating groups, for instance I am part of a group on my Facebook called Everything Schaumburg, where people post about things happening around town. Facebook also
                        has the messenger app which is used more for conversations, although I personally never use it as I think that is one of the weaker points of Facebook.
                        <br><br>
                        On the other hand, I think that one of Snapchat's biggest strengths is conversation, along with groups, relationships, and sharing. I think a lot of people have switched from using text messaging to using Snapchat to communicate, as it does a great job of making it easy to
                        create small groups of friends or communicate individually with someone, and it's biggest strength is being able to include pictures or videos in your conversation compared to text messaging. Snapchat also focuses on the presence part of the model a bit, as it lets you know
                        when users are replying or seen your messages or videos, along with where they are currently located.
                        <br><br>
                        The social media website Twitter also has a big strenth on the conversation part of the model. It is basically the main point of Twitter, to communicate with people. It is unique though in that it does a great job of creating relationships through the use of hashtags # to
                        connect your thoughts and opinions with other users using that particular hashtag. It also gives it's users a good sense of identity, partly because you must be verified through Twitter so that another user can't make fake posts using your name, but also because there is a
                        freedom of speech that Twitter gives it's users to voice their own individual opinions and thoughts.
                        <br><br>
                        Those are just some examples of honeycomb model being used by some of the most popular social media websites, and even though they might try, it is hard to perfect all parts of the model, and that each particular website can be useful for different things. The websites will continue
                        to evolve in the future, and they must always try to improve in order to stay relavent.
