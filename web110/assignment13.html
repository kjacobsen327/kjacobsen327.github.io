        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>This week I learned what exactly a database is, and why SQL exists. I can see that it can be a very efficient
            way to either find or change data, especially in a very large database. I see how learning more about SQL
            and databases could lead into a career for database management and analysis, especially for bigger companies
            that may have many large databases for employees, customer accounts, inventory, etc. I'm going to be taking
            the CIS 143 course: Introduction to Database Systems as well so this was a nice preview of what's to come
            and how much more there is to learn about databases and SQL.</p>
