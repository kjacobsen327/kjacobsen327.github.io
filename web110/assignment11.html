    <h1>Assignment 11 Summary</h1>

    <p>Knowing how to add images, audio, and video to a website is essential. Pretty much every website uses them, and
        it's what makes a website unique and not just a big block of text of information. I haven't had a chance to try
        out adding in audio or video yet in my web150 class, so it was nice to try it out here. Adding video from
        Youtube is super easy, adding images and audio is easy too, once you make an images folder and keep your media
        inside it. The assignment this week will come in handy for my other class this year.</p>
