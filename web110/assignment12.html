        <h2>Activity 1:</h2>
        <p>I chose to the third activity, which was to use the Wave web accessibility evaluation tool on a page. I
            tested it
            out on the wikiversity page. I saw how the page was laid out pretty well for accessibility. This tool will
            be
            helpful to check for errors on my own web pages.
            The other part of the activity was to review the page: How to Write Good Alt Text. I learned some good
            things
            there, and that for the future, an easy way of thinking how to write alt text is to imagine you're trying to
            describe an image in detail over the phone. I thought this was a good way of thinking about it. I also
            learned
            not to start every alt text of an image with "image of..." as it can get very annoying for someone to hear
            that
            constantly.

        <h2>Activity 2:</h2>
        <p>The other activity I chose to do was the 5th one, to use the Paletton website to play around with color
            schemes.
            I bookmarked this website to use in the future, I really liked how it had the other features of an example
            website using your color scheme, and also an option to simulate how the colors would look for someone with
            color
            blindness. This is a great way to test color options that may look fine, but to someone with color blindness
            the
            colors might look too similar and would make the site much harder to navigate.</p>
