        <h2>IT Careers: Activity</h2>
        <p>I chose to do the third activity, which was to work on my resume, as well as work on my LinkedIn profile. 
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-jacobsen327">https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-jacobsen327</a>
        </p>
        <p>I already had a resume and a LinkedIn account, but hadn't touched them in a year, so I updated them to be
            current now. I also updated the jobs section in LinkedIn to keep me updated on any possible web development
            internships. As far as networking goes, I do not know many people in tech careers right now, but I have told
            people that I have been getting into web development. I actually have a friend whose dad is a photographer,
            and would be interested in setting up a website to show off his photography. I think it will be a summer
            project for me, but it will be good experience and will help to start building a portfolio!
