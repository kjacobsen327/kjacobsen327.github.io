    <!-- part of the assignment to add inline css to h1 element -->
    <h1 style="color: blue">Assignment 10 Summary</h1>

    <p>This week in learning about CSS, and doing the activities of creating the external style sheet, and also applying
        internal and inline CSS, I learned an important lesson. Make sure your HTML is written correctly before you
        start trying to add a bunch of CSS! Since the beginning of the semester, since I was still new to all this, my
        HTML was written kind of goofy, so when I linked the external css to each assignment, it now looks goofy as
        well.
    </p>
    <p>I fixed my HTML in this assignment which makes it easier for me to change any styles in the future, and saves a
        lot of time.
