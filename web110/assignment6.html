                <h3>Activity 1:</h3>
                    <p>
                        I chose to do the activity to use screen sharing / remote desktop. I looked at the three examples of remote desktop options the activity gave,
                        and chose to try Chrome Remote Desktop as that seemed the quickest and easiest to get started with.
                         <br><br>
                        It was definately easy to set up, within a minute of downloading and installing the extension in Chrome on my desktop, I was able to access my computer screen from my phone.
                        I only played around with it a little bit, but I can see the usefulness that an application like this could possible bring me in the future. As it seems like a lot of jobs are
                        slowly changing to a more hybrid work environment, I can see how nice this would be if you have a job where you might be at the office part of the week and work from home the other
                        part. Being able to access something on your work computer from somewhere else that quick would be very useful.
                        <br><br>
                        Until then, it could be useful to me for helping someone else out with their computer from my own.

                <h3>Activity 2:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The other activity I chose to do was to review the RIAA:About Piracy site and research legal issues and potential penalties related to illegal peer-to-peer file sharing.
                        <br><br>
                        I learned from the wikipedia page that: "In the case of file sharing networks, companies claim that peer-to-peer file sharing enables the violation of their copyrights.
                        File sharing allows any file to be reproduced and redistributed indefinitely. Therefore, the reasoning is that if a copyrighted work is on a file sharing network, whoever uploaded or downloaded the file is liable for violating the copyright because they are reproducing the work without the authorization of the copyright holder or the law."
                        This means that the user is responsible for making sure that the file they are downloading from a p2p site is not copyrighted, or else you can be charged for downloading it. I think that it is important that the media artists get paid for their work and if their work was out there being transfered all over for free they would not be able 
                        to keep creating their art. I used to download music and movies from p2p sites and not think much of it, but now I use streaming services like Spotify and Netflix instead.
