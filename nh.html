            <h3>Aura of Dread:</h3>
            <em>The very existence of the Nighthaunt is a stark reminder of the terrible fate that awaits the
                living.</em>
            <p>Enemy units are terrified while they are within 3" of any friendly NIGHTHAUNT units. While a unit
                is
                terrified, it cannot issue or receive the Inspiring Presence command. This ability has no effect
                on
                NIGHTHAUNT units.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethereal:</h3>
            <em>Nighthaunt spirits are nigh on impossible to land a blow upon and can pass through the corporeal
                at will.</em>
            <p>Friendly NIGHTHAUNT units have a ward of 6+.
                In addition, friendly NIGHTHAUNT units can retreat
                and still charge in the same turn.
                Ignore modifiers (positive and negative) to save rolls for
                attacks that target friendly NIGHTHAUNT units.
            </p>

            <h3>Vanishing Phantasms:</h3>
            <em>The Nighthaunt appear and disappear from sight to torment their prey.</em>
            <p>At the end of deployment, before determining control of objectives, you can remove up to 3
                friendly NIGHTHAUNT units from the battlefield and place them to one side to be set up in ambush as
                reserve units. At the end of your movement phase, you can set up 1 or more of the reserve units
                in ambush on the battlefield, more than 9" from all enemy units.
