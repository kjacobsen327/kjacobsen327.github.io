                    living.</em>
                <p>Enemy units are terrified while they are within 3" of any friendly NIGHTHAUNT units. While a unit is
                    terrified, it cannot issue or receive the Inspiring Presence command. This ability has no effect on
                    NIGHTHAUNT units.

                    <em>Nighthaunt spirits are nigh on impossible to land a blow upon and can pass through the corporeal
                        at will.</em>
                <p>Friendly NIGHTHAUNT units have a ward of 6+. In addition, friendly NIGHTHAUNT units can retreat and
                    still charge in the same turn. Ignore modifiers (positive and negative) to save rolls for attacks
                    that target friendly NIGHTHAUNT units.

                    <em>The Nighthaunt appear and disappear from sight to torment their prey.</em>
                <p>At the end of deployment, before determining control of objectives, you can remove up to 3 friendly
                    NIGHTHAUNT units from the battlefield and place them to one side to be set up in ambush as reserve
                    units. At the end of your movement phase, you can set up 1 or more of the reserve units in ambush on
                    the battlefield, more than 9" from all enemy units.
