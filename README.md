Hello, my name is Kevin Jacobsen.

This is my 2nd semester here at Harper learning about web development.

I am hoping to take the web200 class in order to use javascript to help build web pages. I am interested in not only using javascript to begin a career in web development eventually, but also to possibly help learn some of the basics for other computer coding languages someday. I do not have much experience using javascript yet, but I am ready to learn!
