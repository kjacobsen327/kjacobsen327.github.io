Hello, my name is Kevin Jacobsen.

Nice to meet you!

This is my 2nd semester here at Harper learning about web development, hopefully to get an associates degree and start a better career for myself.

I am hoping to take the web200 class in order to use javascript to help build web pages. I first learned a little HTML and CSS in the spring of 2023, and I had a lot of fun building my first web page. I am interested in not only using javascript to begin a career in web development eventually, but also to possibly help learn some of the basics for other computer coding languages someday. I do not have much experience using javascript yet, but I hope I can learn a lot more about it this semester.
