Hello, my name is Kevin Jacobsen.

Nice to meet you!

This is my 2nd semester here at Harper learning about web development, hopefully to get an associates degree and start a better career for myself.

I am hoping to take the web200 class in order to use javascript to help build web pages. I first learned a little HTML and CSS in the spring of 2023, and I had a lot of fun building my first web page. I am interested in not only using javascript to begin a career in web development eventually, but also to possibly help learn some of the basics for other computer coding languages someday. I do not have much experience using javascript yet, but I hope I can learn a lot more about it this semester.

After finishing the web200 final project, I can definitely say I have learned so much this semester, as well as realized how much more there is to learn about using JavaScript. I was able to build a single page application for ordering pizzas, using form input information, adding and removing data inside of an array, creating objects used to build customer info and pizzas,creaing multiple functions, and updating pricing automatically. The form was then submitted as a JSON format. After spending a semester learning some of these basics, it only makes me want to learn more about JavaScript and what it can do, about learning jQuery to shorten some aspects of coding, and about learning more on what happens after submitting a form. But for now, I'm happy with the way my project turned out and I had a lot of fun with it!
